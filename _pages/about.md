I'm currently a researcher at the [Center for AI Safety](https://safe.ai/), where I most recently worked on a benchmark measuring digital labor automation. Previously, I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, where I co-led the [Berkeley AI Safety Initiative for Students (BASIS)](https://berkeleyaisafety.com/). I have also conducted research at [Berkeley SkyLab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) and [Mila](https://www.complexdatalab.com/poli-sci/).
